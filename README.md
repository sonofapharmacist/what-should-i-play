So you were a dummy like the rest of us and have too many games to play on your PC and you don't know where to start.

Attack that pile of shame with what-should-i-play!

what-should-i-play is the super cool python script that takes the contents of your windows desktop and chooses one of its contents at random.

Never get stuck staring at your screen and play, stupid!

### Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Windows OS (for path to shortcuts on Desktop)
- Your game's shortcuts are on the desktop



### Future state
- Determine OS to determine Desktop for Linux compatability
- Search for steamapps / common to find the installed games, to avoid leaving anything out in the random choice
- hook in to steam API to get all games owned in steam
